# AdvancedEarlyDiseasePrediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for the early prediction of diseases based on symptoms and medical data. By analyzing a dataset that includes symptoms, diseases, and relevant factors such as patient history, the model leverages algorithm: neural networks to predict the likelihood of various diseases, and relevant factors such as patient history, the model leverages algorithm like neural networks to predict the likelihood of various diseases at an early stage. The goal is to empower healthcare professionals with accurate predictions, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans for improved patient outcomes. This system aims to make healthcare more proactive and efficient by detecting diseases early, particularly in high-risk individuals.
