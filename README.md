# AdvancedEarlyDiseasePrediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for the early prediction of diseases based on symptoms and medical data. By analyzing a dataset that includes symptoms, diseases, and relevant factors such as patient history, the model leverages algorithm: neural networks to predict the likelihood of various diseases.
